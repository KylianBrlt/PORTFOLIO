    aboutText2: "This section details my contribution to the \"Smart Chicken\" year project, focusing on the automated egg collection system. As part of a larger initiative to create a smart chicken coop, my role involved designing and implementing a mechanism to automatically retrieve eggs after they were detected. This system aimed to reduce manual effort, minimize egg damage, and integrate seamlessly with the thermal egg detection. The ultimate goal was to create a fully functional smart coop, as depicted in the project overview image.",
